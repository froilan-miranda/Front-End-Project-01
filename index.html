            <h1>Arsenal F.C.</h1>
            <p>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club 
                based in Islington, London, England that plays in the 
                Premier League, the top flight of English football. 
                The club has won 13 league titles (including one 
                unbeaten title), a record 14 FA Cups, two League 
                Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, the League Centenary 
                Trophy, one European Cup Winners' Cup, and one 
                Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.</p>
            <p>Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to 
                join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the 
                First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, 
                they continue the longest streak in the top division,[3] 
                and have won the second-most top-flight matches in 
                English football history.[4] In the 1930s, Arsenal won 
                five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another 
                FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, 
                they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 
                1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA 
                Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 
                20th century with the highest average league position.</p>
            <p>Herbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal 
                forever, won the club its first silverware, and his 
                legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s decade; 
                Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934, aged 55. 
                He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and 
                shirt numbers; he also added the white sleeves and 
                brighter red to the club's jersey.[7] Arsène Wenger was 
                the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. 
                He won a record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team 
                set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten 
                league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004,[8] receiving 
                the nickname The Invincibles.</p>
